/// without rebuilding the child widget.
///
/// This is useful for scenarios where you need to dynamically update
/// painting properties such as the [painter], [foregroundPainter],
/// [isComplex], and [willChange] flags without affecting the child widget.
///
/// The [initIsComplex] and [initWillChange] parameters set the initial values
/// for the respective properties.
/// The [initForegroundPainter] and [initPainter] parameters set the initial
/// custom painters.
/// The [child] parameter is the widget to be painted on.
