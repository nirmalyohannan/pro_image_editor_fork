#### **Breaking Changes:**
- Move `onImageEditingComplete`, `onCloseEditor` and `onUpdateUI` callbacks inside `callbacks: ProImageEditorCallbacks()`.
- Change the `allowCompleteWithEmptyEditing` config to `allowEmptyEditCompletion`. Use it new like this `configs: ProImageEditorConfigs(imageGenerationConfigs: ImageGeneratioConfigs(allowEmptyEditCompletion: false))`. The default value is now also `true` and not `false` anymore.
- Change the layer initial offset position to the center of the screen, not the top left.
- Rename `ColorFilterGenerator` to `FilterModel`.

- Generate configs to change things like the output format 
 

#### **fix:**
- Layer rendering outside the background image now works everywhere.
- The editor no longer depends on packages that only work with supported "native" functionality, which ensures that the editor works on all platforms. This fixes issue #23.

#### **perf:**
- Changes are handled internally across all editors, so there's no conversion delay when opening or closing the Crop-Rotate Editor.
- Image generation is now isolated from the main thread, speeding up the process significantly. On the web, it runs inside separate web workers.
- Filters recalculate matrix only when they change and not after every state refresh.
- Faster emoji rendering when scrolling in the Emoji Editor.
